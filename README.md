In summary, I came up with 5 pivot tables. Below is a summary of each.
### Sales Performance Analysis:
The Sales Performance pivot table summarizes sales figures over time, highlighting yearly trends and selected monthly insights. In 2013, sales totalled $26,415.3K, while 2014 saw a significant increase to $ 92,311.1 K. Notable monthly sales include $9,295.6K in October 2013 and $12,375.8K in October 2014. These insights inform strategic decision-making to optimize revenue generation.

### Customer Segmentation Analysis:
The Customer Segmentation pivot table presents a breakdown of profitability across different customer segments. Profitable segments include Government, Small Business, Channel Partners, and Midmarket, contributing to overall revenue. However, the Enterprise segment incurred a loss. Understanding these dynamics enables targeted strategies to enhance profitability by capitalizing on lucrative segments while addressing challenges in less profitable ones.

### Geographical Performance Analysis:
The Geographical Performance pivot table offers insights into sales and profitability across different regions. The United States of America, Canada, France, Germany, and Mexico emerge as significant markets, each contributing substantial sales figures and profits. This analysis allows us to identify key geographical regions driving revenue and profitability, informing strategic decisions related to market expansion, resource allocation, and targeted marketing efforts for sustainable growth.

### Products Analysis:
The Products Analysis pivot table sheds light on the performance of different products based on sales revenue and profitability. Paseo emerges as the top-selling product, generating the highest sales revenue and profit, followed by VTT and Velo. Despite varying sales volumes, each product contributes positively to overall profitability. This analysis aids in identifying top-performing products and allocating resources effectively to capitalize on revenue opportunities, optimize product mix, and drive sustainable growth.

### Discount Impact Analysis:
The Discount Impact pivot table illustrates the effect of different discount levels on units sold. High and Medium discount levels resulted in higher counts of units sold compared to Low and No discounts. This analysis highlights the influence of discounts on consumer purchasing behaviour, emphasizing the potential for discounts to stimulate sales. Understanding the impact of discounting allows for informed decisions on pricing strategies, balancing revenue generation with maintaining profit margins, and optimizing sales performance.
